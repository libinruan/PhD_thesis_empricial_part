This web page displays 15  thumbnails that epitomize the key findings and contribution of my Ph.D. thesis project, titled "`Wealth Taxation in a Life-Cycle Model with Entrepreneurship and Housing`." For legibility, it is advisable to download the original .png files, browsing them in your preferred photo editor.

## How different typical life-cycle wealth is between small business owners and wage earners? 

For expositional convenience, I categories them into two groups. The first nine thumbnails are empirical, in the sense that they are obtained from descriptive statistics computed based on an authoritative household balance sheet data in the United States (the Survey of Consumer Finances).

#### Wage earners stop accumulating more houses after their 40s, compared with business owners

#### Wage earners dissave much more after retirement, as opposed to business owners

## Can we model these patterns in a unified framework?

## If yes, can we answer whether a wealth-based taxation is  the elixir of inequality?

The answer depends on what measure we use, what group of the wealth distribution is of interest, and, from the perspective of a household, which social economical class they are in. Besides, the answer is undoubtedly shaped by how extreme the wealth-based tax is introduced into the economy. Is it a revenue-neutral tax change? Is the tax policy changed to a pure wealth tax system or a tax system with the hybrid of wealth taxes and, say, capital income taxes. 

One scenario I considered in my thesis is a tax scheme that is composed a flat capital income tax and a progressive wealth tax, like what the French economist, Thomas Piketty proposed in his Amazon best seller, "Capital in the Twenty-First Century."

#### Entrepreneurs benefit from the wealth-based tax policy, while wage earners don't

This web page displays 15  thumbnails that epitomize the key findings and contribution of my Ph.D. thesis project, titled "`Wealth Taxation in a Life-Cycle Model with Entrepreneurship and Housing`." For legibility, it is advisable to download the original .png files, browsing them in your preferred photo editor.

## How different typical life-cycle wealth is between small business owners and wage earners? 

For expositional convenience, I categories them into two groups. The first nine thumbnails are empirical, in the sense that they are obtained from descriptive statistics computed based on an authoritative household balance sheet data in the United States (the Survey of Consumer Finances).

## Is a wealth-based taxation the elixir of inequality?

The answer depends on what measure you are using and what demographic characteristic the representative person you are interested in. The characteristics covered in my research include age, capital, occupation, as well as the ability to initiate and sustainably run a business.

#### Entrepreneurs benefit from a wealth-based tax policy, while wage earners don't
